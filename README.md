# ESP32 and Node-RED Communication via MQTT

This base project demonstrates how to establish communication between an ESP32 microcontroller and Node-RED using the MQTT protocol, with a free and public MQTT broker. The ESP32 acts as a client that sends and receives data from Node-RED, which subscribes to these MQTT topics and displays the data in a dashboard.
